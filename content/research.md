My research area is generally in algebra and geometric group theory. Specifically, I am mainly interested in geometric and combinatorial aspects of Coxeter groups, as well as closely related objects like Artin groups and Hecke Algebras. Recently, I have also developed an interest in applying statistics and machine learning in the study of historical cryptology.
