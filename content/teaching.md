My primary professional focus as an Education Focused lecturer is to provide outstanding mathematics and statistics instruction and to enrich students' learning journey in mathematics and statistics courses. 

I enjoy teaching at all levels and helping to make the joy of mathematics and statistics accessible to as many people as possible. In particular, I strive to create a learning environment which is supportive, inclusive and encourages students to connect with mathematics technically, socially and emotionally.

Here are some of the courses I have taught.

UNC Asheville:
* STAT225 - Calculus-based Statistics (2023)
* MATH167 - Precalculus (2023)

Furman University
* MTH120 - Introduction to Statistics (2022, 2023)
* MTH150 - Calculus I (2022)
* MTH145 - Calculus for Management, Life and Social Sciences (2023)

University of Sydney
* MATH1002 Linear Algebra (2020 Summer School)
* MATH1004 Discrete Mathematics (co-taught with [Joel Gibson](https://www.jgibson.id.au/)) (2018 Summer School)


I have also supported a variety of courses as a tutor/supplemental instructor (see my CV for further details).
