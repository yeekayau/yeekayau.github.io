Here is a small collection of some code and web applications I have written for various teaching and research projects.

* [Key length finder](https://vigenere.streamlit.app/): A small web application with various statistics related to finding the key length of a Vigen√®re cipher. Part of a summer research project with undergraduate maths students at Furman University in 2022.

* [Google Colab notebook - Introducing Python for Statistics and Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q5KJdCuj1HNeAwLfDRt4_nOfzDCxBkWP?usp=sharing) This notebook was used for my MATH120 - Introduction to Statistics class at Furman (2023). The notebook implements many of the examples from the textbook [Statistics - Unlocking the Power of Data (3rd Edition)](https://www.lock5stat.com/) using the data sets found at [Lock Datasets](https://www.lock5stat.com/datapage3e.html).

* [Google Colab notebook implementing affine Weyl groups and sign types in Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y29FKCwn6Rkjx4XrDX7gdGTb7q93ot1E?usp=sharing). A python implementation of some of the results of J.Y Shi's work in the paper: [Sign types corresponding to an affine Weyl group](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmath.ecnu.edu.cn%2F%7Ejyshi%2Fmyart%2F1987JLMsign.pdf)
