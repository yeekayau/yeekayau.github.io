I am a Lecturer (Education Focused) in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the [University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au). I completed my PhD in 2021 at Sydney under the direction of Associate Professor [James Parkinson](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/jamesp/).

I returned to Australia in 2024 after holding positions as an Assistant Professor (Tenure-track) at the *University of North Carolina Asheville, NC USA* (July 2023 - Dec 2023) and Visiting Assistant Professor at *Furman University, SC USA* (2022 - 2023). From 2021-2022 I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the *University of Sydney*.
